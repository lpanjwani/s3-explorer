# Tuza S3 Challenge

The project structure has a directory hierarchy containing two main components: the Next.js frontend and the Node.js backend.

Here's a breakdown of the structure:

1. **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project.

2. **Node.js Backend**: This section contains the setup and configuration for the Node.js backend.

    - **Development Setup**: This subsection outlines the prerequisites for running the backend and provides instructions for installation.

    - **Installation**: This subsection explains how to navigate into the backend directory and install the required dependencies using either npm or yarn.

    - **Running the Development Server**: This subsection provides commands to start the development server, which will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

    - **Building the Project**: This subsection explains how to build the backend project using npm or yarn.

    - **Testing**: This section provides instructions for running the test suite for both backend project.

3. **Next.js Frontend**: This section contains the setup and configuration for the Next.js frontend.

    - **Development Setup**: This subsection outlines the prerequisites for running the frontend and provides instructions for installation.

    - **Installation**: This subsection explains how to navigate into the frontend directory and install the required dependencies using either npm or yarn.

    - **Running the Development Server**: This subsection provides commands to start the development server, allowing you to view the frontend in your browser at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

    - **Building the Project**: This subsection explains how to build the frontend project using npm or yarn.

    - **Testing**: This section provides instructions for running the test suite for both the frontend project using npm or yarn.

Overall, the project structure follows a common pattern for web development projects, separating the frontend and backend components and providing instructions for setup, installation, running the development server, building the project, and running tests.
